DO!T is a simple and minimalistic Todo list web app inspired by @developedbyed tutorial on JS based Todo app. This web app includes lines of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, ofcourse.
Although the raw layout and the app is complete but I am looking to add some transitions and switching between dark mode to light mode and vice-versa.
